# Scriptaculous.vim

This is a initial commit for the Scriptaculous Test plugin.

### WHAT IT DOES:
* can be disabled setting the flag `g:loaded_scriptaculous` to 1
* provides *file detection* for Scriptaculous test (any *Spec.js or *SpecHelper.js under the folder js-test or test-javascript)
* provides *snippets* for the majority of default matchers (assertEqual, assertTrue, assertMatch, ...)

 *snippets need the Snipmate plugin to work* [Snipmate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate "Snipmate")

### WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO:
* it doesn't have a specific syntax highlighting
* it doesn't run the tests from inside Vim
